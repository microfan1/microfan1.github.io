## Research
My recent research interests mainly focus on econometric theory, with topics including causal inference with machine learning, and high dimensional portfolio theory. I also have some ongoing projects relating to applied econometrics, emphasizing machine learning and big data. Data and (Stata, R) codes for some of my articles can be found in my personal website.
